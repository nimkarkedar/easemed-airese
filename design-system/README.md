# Airese design system

Everything used to build the Airese app: tokens, type, motion, icons, brand assets and every React Native component, with where each one is used.

**Everything here is built in React Native** (Expo SDK 57, TypeScript). There is no separate Figma library or web component kit: the code is the source of truth. Voice, tone and visual rules are in [docs/BRAND.md](../docs/BRAND.md); what the product does is in [docs/PRD.md](../docs/PRD.md).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Tokens | [`src/theme/tokens.ts`](../src/theme/tokens.ts) |
| Motion | [`src/theme/motion.ts`](../src/theme/motion.ts) |
| Components | [`src/components/`](../src/components/) (all exported from [`index.ts`](../src/components/index.ts)) |
| Brand assets | [`assets/`](../assets/) |
| **This page, visual version** | **https://nimkarkedar.github.io/easemed-airese/design-system/** (real swatches, type in Montserrat and Inter, icons, motion demos; generated from the code by `scripts/build-design-system.mjs`) |
| See it running | https://nimkarkedar.github.io/easemed-airese/ |

**The rules in one line each:**
- Screens use tokens and components only: no hard-coded colours, sizes, timings or curves.
- See-through colours are a palette colour at an opacity: `alpha(colors.moon, 0.24)`, never a hand-typed `rgba()`.
- Text uses `AppText`; icons use `Icon`.
- Every animation uses a motion preset.
- Everything meets WCAG 2.2 AAA.
- Keep the system small: add a token or component only when a screen needs it.

The swatch images on this page are written from `tokens.ts` every time the design system builds (`npm run design-system`), so they always match the code.

## 1. Colour

**"Night, with one warm light."** A dark UI for use in bed, with one warm accent used sparingly. One red, Flare, for the loudest snoring in charts and form-error marks; a coral tint of it for the single Book a call button on a repeated pattern.

### Palette

| | Name | Token | Hex | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![](swatches/night.svg) | Night | `colors.night` | `#05070F` | Deepest background, shadows |
| ![](swatches/midnight.svg) | Midnight | `colors.midnight` | `#0B1020` | App background |
| ![](swatches/deep.svg) | Deep | `colors.deep` | `#19294E` | Cards, sheets, form groups |
| ![](swatches/mist.svg) | Mist | `colors.mist` | `#B3BDD3` | Muted text (7:1+ on Midnight and Deep) |
| ![](swatches/moon.svg) | Moon | `colors.moon` | `#EEF1F7` | Text, titles |
| ![](swatches/breath.svg) | Breath | `colors.breath` | `#9DB4FF` | Accent: primary buttons, links, focus |
| ![](swatches/lamp.svg) | Lamp | `colors.lamp` | `#F4B65F` | The one warm light: the remedy button on an unusual night, the "what it means" wash. Use sparingly. |
| ![](swatches/ember.svg) | Ember | `colors.ember` | `#FFAA5C` | Data: snoring |
| ![](swatches/iris.svg) | Iris | `colors.iris` | `#B9A3FF` | Data: breathing pauses |
| ![](swatches/dew.svg) | Dew | `colors.dew` | `#8EE3CF` | Data: sleep and rest |
| ![](swatches/flare.svg) | Flare | `colors.flare` | `#FF5A4F` | The one red: loudest snoring in charts, form-error marks, the pattern graph line |

### Roles and special colours (what screens use)

| | Role | Token | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Background | `colors.background` | Midnight |
| | Surface | `colors.surface` | Deep |
| | Text | `colors.text` | Moon |
| | Muted text | `colors.textMuted` | Mist |
| | Accent | `colors.accent` | Breath |
| | Text on accent | `colors.onAccent` | Midnight (also the label on Lamp and `urgentAction` buttons) |
| ![](swatches/divider.svg) | Divider | `colors.divider` | Mist at 18% |
| ![](swatches/scrim.svg) | Scrim | `colors.scrim` | Night at 70%, behind sheets |
| ![](swatches/error.svg) | Error text | `colors.error` | `#FFA49B`, a light tint of Flare (7.5:1 on Deep, 10:1 on Midnight) |
| ![](swatches/error-mark.svg) | Error mark | `colors.errorMark` | Flare: the field ring and icon, never text |
| ![](swatches/urgent-action.svg) | Urgent action | `colors.urgentAction` | Coral `#FF7F72`, Flare lightened: **only** Book a call on a repeated pattern. Midnight label 7.7:1; 5.3:1 against the wine card |
| ![](swatches/tint-accent.svg) | Breath wash | `colors.tintAccent` | Breath at 16%: profile tile badges, the selected gender tile, the missed-nights note, the Last night tag |
| ![](swatches/brand.svg) | Airese navy | `colors.brand` | `#2E3A5A`: logo, decks, Android icon background |
| ![](swatches/white.svg) | White | `colors.white` | `#FFFFFF`: logo on the splash, switch thumbs |

### Data colours

One colour per kind of data, the same everywhere: charts, data icons, legends, score rings. **Marks and icons only, never text, buttons or links.** Every chart also labels or shapes its marks, so colour is never the only cue. Checked together on Deep and Midnight for colour-blind separation (ΔE 12+) and 3:1+ contrast.

| | Data | Token | Hex | Soft tint (icon badges, level chips) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![](swatches/ember.svg) | Snoring | `colors.dataSnoring` | `#FFAA5C` (Ember) | ![](swatches/tint-snoring.svg) `colors.tintSnoring` |
| ![](swatches/iris.svg) | Breathing pauses | `colors.dataBreathing` | `#B9A3FF` (Iris) | ![](swatches/tint-breathing.svg) `colors.tintBreathing` |
| ![](swatches/dew.svg) | Sleep and rest | `colors.dataSleep` | `#8EE3CF` (Dew) | ![](swatches/tint-sleep.svg) `colors.tintSleep` |
| | Warm wash | `colors.tintWarm` | Lamp at 10% | ![](swatches/tint-warm.svg) for the "what it means" card |

Breath stays out of charts: it's the UI colour, and too close to Iris for colour-blind readers. Earlier nights in charts use a neutral Moon tint (`alpha(colors.moon, 0.14–0.16)`).

### Loudness ramp

![](swatches/loudness-ramp.svg)

`loudness` in tokens: cyan, yellow, orange, Flare red. Each step is pinned to a decibel level, so only truly loud snoring reaches red. **Charts and graphs only**, never text, buttons or UI chrome. Also the Sound Score ring and the calendar rings.

| | Level | Token | Hex |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![](swatches/loud-light.svg) | Light | `loudness.light` | `#2EC9EA` |
| ![](swatches/loud-moderate.svg) | Moderate | `loudness.moderate` | `#FFD84A` |
| ![](swatches/loud-loud.svg) | Loud | `loudness.loud` | `#FF9A3C` |
| ![](swatches/loud-very-loud.svg) | Very loud | `loudness.veryLoud` | `#FF5A4F` (Flare) |

### Gradients

| | Name | Token | Stops (top to bottom) | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![](swatches/gradient-splash.svg) | Splash | `gradients.splash` | `#0B1020` → `#1C3470` → `#225ED8` | Splash, Home and Recording backgrounds (`AmbientGradient`), the record button's fill |
| ![](swatches/gradient-hero.svg) | Hero | `gradients.hero` | `#1C3470` → `#19294E` | Verdict card, ordinary and first nights; the no-data card |
| ![](swatches/gradient-hero-watch.svg) | Hero, watch | `gradients.heroWatch` | `#3D2E3C` → `#19294E` | Verdict card, unusual night (a warm dusk) |
| ![](swatches/gradient-hero-urgent.svg) | Hero, urgent | `gradients.heroUrgent` | `#5A1C24` → `#2E1830` | Verdict card, repeated pattern (wine into plum) |

### Verdict moods

The verdict card at the top of a report ([`VerdictCard`](../src/components/VerdictCard.tsx)): card colours, the graph behind the words, and the one button. No icons, no dial: the words and the graph carry it.

| Night | Card | Graph | Button |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary, first night | `gradients.hero`, soft Breath glow | Breath line, low and nearly flat (real data) | **Keep tracking**, Breath |
| Unusual | `gradients.heroWatch`, soft Lamp glow | Lamp line climbing to tonight (real data) | **Try using a remedy**, Lamp |
| Repeated pattern | `gradients.heroUrgent`, soft Flare glow that breathes | Flare line, a drawn climb across the card (a picture, not data) | **Book a call** with a phone icon, `urgentAction` |

**Readability budget:** behind the words, the card gradient, glow, graph fill (4%), graph line (6 to 14%) and shine together keep Moon body text at 7:1 or more at the card's brightest point (measured 9:1 or better). Below the words the graph fades up to full strength. The glow strengths (10%, 10%, 16%) are capped for the same reason.

---

## 2. Typography

**Montserrat for titles and buttons; Inter for everything you read.** Both from Google Fonts (`@expo-google-fonts/montserrat`, `@expo-google-fonts/inter`). **Two weights only: regular (400) and semibold (600).**

| Variant | Font | Size / line height | Weight | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | Montserrat | 32 / 40 | Semibold | Page titles, big numbers |
| `headline` | Montserrat | 24 / 32 | Semibold | Onboarding headlines; emoji flags take this size |
| `heading` | Montserrat | 20 / 28 | Semibold | Card and sheet titles, the calendar month |
| `body` | Inter | 16 / 24 | Regular | All reading text (the base), form inputs, Recording screen text |
| `small` | Inter | 14 / 22 | Regular | Secondary detail, labels, legends, section labels |
| `caption` | Inter | 12 / 18 | Regular | The minimum: credits, fine print, tab labels |
| `button` | Montserrat | 16 / 20 | Regular | Button labels |
| `buttonSmall` | Montserrat | 14 / 18 | Regular | Mini buttons in banners and cards |

- **Scale:** steps of about 1.25 (major third): 12 · 14 · 16 · 20 · 24 · 32. **Nothing smaller than 12.**
- **Line height:** at least 1.5× for reading text (WCAG 1.4.8).
- **Title colour:** Moon on every page, including Home over its gradient.
- **Section labels:** one style everywhere (`FormTitle`): small, uppercase, Mist, 1 pt tracking.
- **Action labels under the big buttons:** `body` in Moon ("Tap to start recording", "Tap to stop recording").
- **Big numbers:** one size and weight, with no small units. Compact durations ("7h 36m") only in big numbers; sentences say "1 hr 20 min".
- **Dynamic Type:** text scales with the system setting up to 200% (`maxFontSizeMultiplier={2}` in `AppText`).
- **Digits:** times use tabular figures, so they don't jump as they change.
- **Exception:** the browser-only system alert stand-in uses the system font on purpose (it imitates iOS).

## 3. Spacing, corners and layout

### Spacing (4-pt grid), `space`

| Token | Value | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xs` | 4 | Text to its subtitle |
| `sm` | 8 | Icon to label, small gaps |
| `md` | 12 | Between related items |
| `lg` | 16 | Inside rows, between cards in a pair; a tab title's distance below the status bar (`PAGE_TITLE_TOP`) |
| `xl` | 24 | Between sections, card padding |
| `xxl` | 32 | Big separations, footers |
| `gutter` | 20 | **The one screen edge** for every screen (iOS standard); also `PAGE_SIDE` |

### Corners, `radius`

| Token | Value | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `md` | 12 | Small surfaces, search fields, picker bands |
| `lg` | 16 | Cards, form groups, tiles |
| `xl` | 20 | Banners, the verdict card, the Recording tips box |
| `card` | 24 | Data cards (Recording Details) |
| `sheet` | 28 | Sheet corners (bottom and top sheets), Home banner |
| `pill` | 999 | Buttons, chips, tags, toasts |

Circles use half their own size; that's geometry, not a token.

### Layout constants

| Constant | Value | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Touch target | 44 pt minimum | Every control (buttons 48, mini buttons 36 + 4 pt hit slop, icon buttons 56, setting rows 64, calendar days 48) |
| Tab title row | 16 pt below the status bar, 44 pt tall, control on the right | `PageTitle`, `PAGE_TITLE_TOP`; Home and Reports |
| Title-row control | 44 pt glassy circle (Moon 14%, Moon 24% edge) | `titleControl` in `Avatar.tsx`: the avatar and the calendar button |
| Sticky top bar | 44 pt below the status bar | `DetailPage`; controls in it are plain Breath glyphs |
| Tab bar clearance | 96 pt (`TAB_BAR_CLEARANCE`) | Bottom padding on tab screens; a sticky footer sits 24 pt above the tab bar |
| Form row | 52 pt minimum | `FormInput` |
| Safe areas | `useInsets()` | Every screen |

### Surfaces and depth

The UI is flat: depth comes from colour (Midnight → Deep), not shadows.

- **The exceptions:** a soft glow on the record button and inside the verdict card, a frosted Midnight bar (88%, blurred on web) behind sticky titles, and a soft Night shadow under the Recording tips box.

---

## 4. Motion

**Two presets, one feel: like settling down for the night.** Every animation uses one of these; nothing is hand-tuned per screen. Nothing snaps, bounces or overshoots. Swipes and scrolls follow the finger.

| Preset | Duration | easeOut (arriving) | easeIn (leaving) | easeInOut (between states) | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `motion.slow` | 1200 ms | `bezier(0.3, 0, 0.2, 1)` | `bezier(0.47, 0, 0.745, 0.715)` | `bezier(0.37, 0, 0.63, 1)` | Arrivals: splash, the recording screen surfacing, charts growing in, score rings filling |
| `motion.fast` | 500 ms | `bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` | `bezier(0.4, 0, 0.8, 0.4)` | `bezier(0.45, 0, 0.2, 1)` | Feedback: sheets (bottom and top), page slides, the record ring after a tap, toasts, the Home banner's next message |

| Helper | Value | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `motion.ambient` | 9000 ms, sine in-out | Looping background life: the gradient drift, the record button's breathing |
| `motion.attention` | 1800 ms, then 3000 ms rest | The light that runs once round the record ring to invite a tap; the urgent verdict card's breathing glow |
| `motion.glint` | 2400 ms, then 7000 ms rest | A tiny shine that draws the verdict card's graph on load, then glides along the finished line now and then |
| `motion.stagger` | 350 ms | Offset between steps, so things arrive in sequence, not all at once |
| `motion.useNativeDriver` | `false` on web | The native driver isn't available in the browser |

**Reduce Motion** (`useReducedMotion()`) is always respected:
- slides become fades;
- loops hold still;
- charts and the verdict graph are drawn at once, with no shine.

---

## 5. Icons

**Material Symbols (Material 3), Outlined**, weight 400, grade 0, optical size 48, through the `Icon` component only. Paths are copied from the official set (`@material-symbols/svg-400`). `_fill` names are the filled variant, used for selected states.

| Group | Icons |
| --- | --- |
| Navigation | `chevron_left`, `chevron_right`, `keyboard_arrow_down`, `arrow_forward`, `keyboard_double_arrow_right`, `close`, `home`, `home_fill` |
| Actions | `add`, `remove`, `edit`, `edit_note`, `delete`, `call`, `location_on`, `search`, `play_fill`, `pause_fill`, `stop_fill`, `check` |
| Forms | `check_box`, `check_box_outline_blank` |
| Recording and sound | `mic`, `mic_fill`, `graphic_eq`, `airwave`, `monitoring`, `history` |
| Sleep and time | `bedtime`, `bedtime_fill`, `schedule`, `schedule_fill`, `calendar_month`, `bed` |
| Status and trends | `check_circle`, `visibility`, `trending_up`, `trending_down`, `trending_flat`, `warning`, `error`, `info`, `lightbulb` |
| People and settings | `person`, `group`, `notifications`, `settings`, `lock`, `mail`, `description` |
| About you | `male`, `female`, `transgender`, `cake`, `height`, `monitor_weight`, `public` |
| Tips | `battery_charging_full`, `do_not_disturb_on` |

**Native tab bar** (`src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`):
- **Home:** SF Symbols `house` / `house.fill` on iOS; Material `home` on Android.
- **Reports:** SF Symbols `doc.text` / `doc.text.fill` on iOS; Material `description` on Android.

**Flags** (phone country code, where you live) are emoji, sized from the type scale.

**To add an icon:** copy its path from `outlined/<name>.svg` in the official set into `PATHS` in [`Icon.tsx`](../src/components/Icon.tsx), under the same name.

| Favicon (web preview) | [`assets/favicon.png`](../assets/favicon.png) | |

### Illustrations

| Onboarding 1: Let's find out what happens while you sleep | Onboarding 2: Private by default | Onboarding 3: A clearer next step |

**Imagery direction** (BRAND.md): black and white, deep blue, real. Real people asleep in a dim room, toned blue, with an occasional warm bedside lamp. No stock-photo cheer or sci-fi glow.

### Fonts

Montserrat and Inter, 400 and 600 of each, via `@expo-google-fonts/montserrat` and `@expo-google-fonts/inter`, loaded in [`src/app/_layout.tsx`](../src/app/_layout.tsx). On web both come from Google Fonts ([`src/app/+html.tsx`](../src/app/+html.tsx), [`public/iphone.html`](../public/iphone.html)), falling back to `system-ui, sans-serif`.

---

## 9. Patterns

| Pattern | How it's built |
| --- | --- |
| **Levels of detail** | L1 the page → L2 a small `ExplainSheet` for "why?" → a `LargeSheet` for "more" on a card. Dismissing returns to exactly where the user was. |
| **Tabs** | Home and Reports. Every tab's page uses `PageTitle`'s row: the same title, position and glassy control on the right. |
| **Pages from a row** | `DetailPage`: system push on device (slide in, swipe back); slides itself in on web. Back names where it goes. |
| **One message at a time** | Home's banner shows the single most useful message, by priority, with a mini button under the text. |
| **Short forms** | Type only what has to be typed (name, phone, email); everything else is a tile that opens a sheet for one question. Explanations live behind (i), not in footers. |
| **Grouped settings** | `FormGroup` cards holding `FormInput`, `SettingRow` or `SettingSwitch`, separated by `FormDivider`. |
| **Edit with a draft** | Edits are local until **Save** (sticky footer); Back discards them. Each field is checked on leaving it and again on Save. |
| **Confirm, then confirm it happened** | A `BottomSheet` with a plain title, what will happen, the action (named), and Cancel. Then a `Toast`. |
| **Permissions** | Ask in onboarding; never a wall; ask again in context with `PermissionSheet`, which switches to "Open Settings" once the system won't ask again. |
| **Empty states** | One heading, one helpful sentence that says what to do, one action. |
| **Charts** | A sentence above every chart. Single series has no legend; two or more get a legend with shapes. Each has a text alternative. Grows in once with the slow preset. |
| **Graphs behind text** | Everything behind the words (gradient, glow, fill, line, shine) must leave body text at 7:1 or more; strengthen a graph only where there's no text. |
| **Numbers** | One big number, no small units. Levels are words (Low, Moderate, High; Rarely, Sometimes, Often), never colour alone. |
| **Brand presence** | Quiet: the logo with "Powered by The Air Station" on the splash and at the end of Profile and Our centres. |

## 10. Accessibility

Target: **WCAG 2.2 AAA.**

- **Contrast:** 7:1 for text. Moon and Mist pass on Midnight and Deep; Midnight on Breath is 9.4:1, on Lamp 10:1, on `urgentAction` 7.7:1. Data colours and controls need 3:1. Text over a graph keeps 7:1 at its brightest point.
- **Targets:** 44 pt minimum for every control.
- **Text size:** nothing below 12 pt; scales to 200%.
- **Colour is never the only cue:** words for levels, shapes for chart events, legends.
- **Motion:** Reduce Motion is respected everywhere.
- **Gestures:**
  - every gesture has a one-finger alternative (zoom buttons for pinch, dashes for the carousel, − / + and typing for the ruler, a row tap for the wheel);
  - charts and the year wheel are adjustable for screen readers (swipe up or down to step);
  - a tap never ends the night (stopping confirms).
- **Screen readers:**
  - every control has a label and state;
  - charts, score tiles and calendar days have spoken summaries ("Wednesday 7 October, Sound Score 62");
  - toasts and live values use polite live regions;
  - decorative images and graphs are hidden.

## 11. Dependencies

Design-relevant packages (all Expo SDK 57 compatible):

| Package | For |
| --- | --- |
| `react-native` 0.86, `react-native-web` | UI, browser preview |
| `react-native-svg` | Icons, logo, charts, rings, gradients, the verdict graph |
| `@expo-google-fonts/montserrat`, `@expo-google-fonts/inter`, `expo-font` | Type |
| `expo-router` (native tabs) | Navigation, tab bar |
| `react-native-safe-area-context` | Safe areas |
| `expo-splash-screen`, `expo-status-bar` | Launch, status bar style |
| `expo-audio`, `expo-notifications` | Microphone and notification permissions |
| `expo-haptics` | A soft tick as the wheel and ruler pickers change |
| `libphonenumber-js` | Phone number formatting and validation |
| `expo-constants` | App version in Profile |
| `expo-linking` | Call and directions links |

---

## 12. Housekeeping

Things to tidy or decide before handover:

- **App icon and splash icon are placeholders.** They're Expo's default template images. Replace them with the Airese mark before any store build.
- **Unused:** `Screen` and the horizontal logo (`airese-logo-hori.svg`). Keep them or remove them.
- **Overlaps:** `NightTimeline` and `SnoringChart` both draw the night. The timeline now only appears in the All clips sheet.
- **Lint:** the React Compiler rules (`react-hooks/refs`, `set-state-in-effect`) flag the `Animated.Value` refs used across the animation code. It's a known pattern, not a bug; moving animations to Reanimated would clear it.
- **Brand navy:** its role in the dark UI is still open (BRAND.md).

## 13. Adding to the system

1. **Check first:** can an existing token or component do it? Keep the system small.
2. **Tokens:** add to `tokens.ts` with a comment saying what it's for. Colours need a contrast check (7:1 for text, 3:1 for marks and controls); data colours also need a colour-blind check. Tints use `alpha()`.
3. **Components:** one file in `src/components/`, exported from `index.ts`. Start with a short doc comment: what it is, how it behaves, its Reduce Motion behaviour, how it reads to screen readers. Add it to `GROUPS` (and a one-line `BLURB`) in `scripts/build-design-system.mjs`.
4. **Motion:** use a preset in `motion.ts`. A new one goes into `motion.ts`, BRAND.md and this page together.
5. **Icons:** copy the official Material Symbols path into `Icon.tsx`.
6. **This page:** update it in the same change. The visual page and the swatches regenerate from the code on every push; check them with `npm run design-system` (writes `preview-dist/design-system/index.html` and `design-system/swatches/`).
